## Overview

SMART (Susun Manajemen Aktivitas Rapi Teratur) is a mobile application designed to help users effectively manage their time and tasks through a unified, user-friendly platform. The project was developed as part of a university practicum and addresses the growing need for integrated personal productivity tools in an increasingly fast-paced world.

By combining scheduling, task tracking, productivity insights, and modern UI/UX, SMART aims to streamline daily activity planning for students, professionals, and anyone who seeks a more organized lifestyle.

## Key Features

- Task Management: Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. Tasks can be categorized and scheduled with due dates and times.
- Interactive Calendar: Users can view tasks by day, week, or month, with clickable dates to access relevant task lists.
- Search Functionality: Find tasks using keywords, time, or day for more intuitive navigation and tracking.
- Push Notifications: Real-time alerts notify users about deleted tasks or upcoming deadlines.
- Security Features: Passwords are hashed for data protection; login includes email format validation and password visibility toggle.
- Floating Action Button (FAB): Enhances user experience by allowing quick task creation from any screen.
- Modern UI/UX: Designed in Figma with a clean, responsive layout built in Android Studio using Kotlin.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: Android Studio with Kotlin
- Backend: PHP, MySQL
- Design: Figma
- Tools: VSCode for API integration, Git for version control



## Challenges and Learnings

Building SMART introduced several technical and design challenges:
- Efficient Data Handling: Designing a database structure that scales with user data while maintaining performance.
- Security: Implementing password hashing and input validation required understanding backend security best practices.
- UX Flow Optimization: Simplifying the task flow and ensuring intuitive navigation was critical, especially for new users.
- Feature Integration: Balancing core functionality with lightweight performance in a mobile context taught valuable lessons about modular development and user feedback cycles.

## Outcome

The SMART application successfully improved usersâ€™ ability to manage their daily routines, with early testing showing enhanced focus and organization. The integration of feedback-based features like FAB, clickable dates, and detailed task views made the app significantly more usable. The project was submitted as part of a final practicum requirement and demonstrated both team collaboration and individual initiative in full-stack mobile app development.
