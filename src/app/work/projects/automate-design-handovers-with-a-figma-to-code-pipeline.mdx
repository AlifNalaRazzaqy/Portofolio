## Overview

As a CS student passionate about all things tech, I love diving into the intersections of software engineering, UI/UX design, mobile development, and game development. In this portfolio, I explore how blending these fields can create intuitive, scalable, and enjoyable user experiences.
In this specific project, I focused on building impactful design solutions that reduce friction in product development. My role included transforming complex workflows into simple, intuitive interfaces while maintaining engineering precision.

## Key Features

- UI/UX Redesign at FLY (2022–Present)
Led a major overhaul of the FLY platform’s interface, resulting in a 20% increase in user engagement and 30% improvement in load performance.

- AI-Enhanced Workflows
Integrated AI tools into the design-to-dev pipeline, enabling designers to prototype and iterate 50% faster through intelligent component recommendations and automated adjustments.

- Mobile and Game Prototypes
Built mobile-first app prototypes and small-scale interactive games using Flutter and Unity, experimenting with gesture-based UX and physics-based interactions.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- Mobile: Flutter, Jetpack Compose
- Game Dev: Unity (C#), Godot
- Design Tools: Figma, Adobe XD
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Vercel
- Other: Firebase, Supabase, MongoDB

## Challenges and Learnings

Working across domains taught me the importance of creating bridges — between designers and developers, between logic and creativity, and between performance and aesthetics. I learned to design not just for functionality, but also for emotional resonance and accessibility.

## Outcome

This multidisciplinary approach has enabled me to work efficiently in collaborative environments, handle both creative and technical challenges, and deliver high-quality user experiences. I continue to explore how to streamline workflows, whether by automating handoffs, optimizing design systems, or crafting responsive UI components.

This project highlights my ability to bridge the gap between design and development through automation and scalable workflows. By combining UI/UX design principles with engineering practices, I developed a solution that transforms static design files into production-ready code with minimal manual effort.

Through this initiative, I demonstrated how design tokens, reusable components, and continuous integration can significantly reduce friction in the design handoff process. Not only does this streamline collaboration between teams, but it also ensures that the final product remains consistent with the original design intent.

The outcome: a faster, more reliable design-to-code pipeline that empowers both designers and developers to focus on what they do best—creating great user experiences and building high-quality products.
